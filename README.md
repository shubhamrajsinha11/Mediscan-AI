## 📌 About the Project

CareSync is a B.Tech Major Project developed at **Sardar Beant Singh State University, Gurdaspur**. It bridges the gap between individuals and timely healthcare guidance by providing an accessible, data-driven platform for disease prediction and personalised health recommendations.

Instead of relying on generic internet searches, CareSync uses a trained **machine learning ensemble** to analyse symptoms and return structured, reliable health insights — instantly.

## 📊 ML Model Details

| Model | Configuration | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| Random Forest | 100 trees, max_depth=20 | 88–95% |
| Logistic Regression | max_iter=1000, C=1.0 | 82–90% |
| Decision Tree | max_depth=20, max_features=sqrt | 80–88% |

The training pipeline applies **mutual information feature selection** (496 → 200 features), **StandardScaler**, and **PCA** (95% variance retained) before training all three models. The best-performing model is automatically selected and saved.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

CareSync uses SQLite with 4 tables:

- **users** — Account credentials and metadata
- **patient_profiles** — Health details (age, weight, height, blood group)
- **prediction_history** — All past predictions with symptoms stored as JSON
- **health_metrics** — BMI, temperature, and risk score snapshots per session
